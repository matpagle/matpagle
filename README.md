##  🐦‍⬛ Hi there
I'm Matteo Giuliani, and I work as a Research Fellow at Sapienza University of Rome, where I also completed my MSc in Ecobiology.

My reseaches focus on eco-acoustic and urban ecology; specifically, I'm interested in the interpretation of the soundscape for conservattion purposes, and the effects of the urban sprawl and human population growth on biodiversity, with particular attention to avian species.

### 🛠️ I'm currently working on:
- Quantifying the magnitude of human noises contribution on the soundscape.
- Investigating the effect of soundscape intruders, i.e., human noises and alien species, on native birds' songs.
- Define the effect of urbanization on multiple taxa, spanning from plants, pollinators

### 🤜🤛 Collaboration 
I’m always open to collaborating on projects that align with my research interests, feel free to get in touch!
