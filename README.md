I'm s Matteo Giuliani, and I work as a Research Fellow at Sapienza University of Rome, where I also completed my MSc in Ecobiology.

My reseaches focus on eco-acoustic and urban ecology; specifically, I'm interested in the interpretation of the soundscape for conservattion purposes, and the effects of the urban sprawl and human population growth on biodiversity, with particular attention to avifauna ð“…©.
